# Sales-Analysis
Data Analyst Project
Project Overview:

The primary goal of this analysis is to derive actionable insights from sales data to enhance decision-making processes. The dataset includes key metrics such as Sales, Quantity, Discount, and Profit across multiple dimensions, including Product Categories, Customer Segments, and Geographical Regions.

Key Components:

Data Extraction and Manipulation (SQL):

Utilized SQL to query and extract relevant data from a relational database, ensuring that the dataset was clean and structured for analysis.
Data Cleaning and Preparation (Excel):

Employed Excel to perform data cleaning tasks, such as handling missing values, correcting data inconsistencies, and preparing the dataset for further analysis.
Data Analysis (Python):

Leveraged Python libraries (such as Pandas and NumPy) to conduct in-depth statistical analysis, identify trends, and calculate key performance indicators (KPIs).
Visualization and Reporting (Tableau):

Created interactive dashboards in Tableau to visually represent the sales data. This includes charts and graphs that highlight sales performance, trends over time, and comparisons across different categories and regions.
The dashboard is designed for easy interpretation, allowing stakeholders to explore the data and gain insights quickly.
Outcomes: The analysis resulted in actionable insights, such as identifying top-performing products, understanding customer behavior, and recognizing sales trends that can inform future marketing strategies and inventory management.
